## Message

🚫 Attempting to edit generated Go file: {{file}}

This file appears to be generated code (starts with `// Code generated by ...`). Generated files should not be edited directly.

**Common patterns detected:**
- `// Code generated by <tool> ... DO NOT EDIT.`
- `// Code generated by golang.org/x/tools/cmd/bundle`
- `// Code generated by protoc-gen-go`
- `// Code generated by gorm.io/gen`
- `// Code generated by <custom-tool>`

**How to fix:**
1. If you need to modify the generated output, find and edit the source template/generator instead
2. Re-run the generator (e.g., `go generate`, `protoc`, `validategen`) after modifying the source
3. If this is a false positive, you may proceed after removing this message
