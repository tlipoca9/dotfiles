Executes a nushell command or script file with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.

All commands run in the project root by default. Use the `workdir` parameter if you need to run a command in a different directory. AVOID using `cd <directory>; <command>` patterns - use `workdir` instead.

Supports two modes:
  1. Inline command: provide the "command" argument with a nushell expression.
  2. Script file: provide the "script" argument with a path to a .nu file (relative to workdir or absolute). You may also pass "script_args" to forward arguments to the script.

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

Before executing the command, please follow these steps:

1. Directory Verification:
   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location
   - For example, before running "mkdir foo/bar", first use `ls foo` to check that "foo" exists and is the intended parent directory

2. Command Execution:
   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes or single quotes (e.g., rm "path with spaces/file.txt")
   - Nushell requires quotes around paths with spaces; unquoted paths with spaces will be parsed as multiple arguments
   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.
   - Capture the output of the command.

Nushell-specific syntax notes:
  - Nushell uses structured data natively. Prefer nu-native commands (ls, open, where, get, select, each, reduce, etc.) over traditional unix commands when possible.
  - Pipelines use `|` with structured data (tables, records, lists), not raw text streams.
  - Variables use `$` prefix: `let name = "world"`, `$name`.
  - String interpolation uses `$"Hello ($name)"` (parentheses inside double-quoted strings).
  - Conditionals use `if` / `else`, not `[ ]` or `test`.
  - Loops: `for item in $list { ... }`, `each { |it| ... }`, `where { |it| ... }`.
  - Nushell does NOT support `&&` for chaining commands. Use `;` to separate sequential commands.
  - Nushell does NOT support `||` for fallback. Use `try { ... } catch { ... }` instead.
  - Closures use `{ |args| body }` syntax.
  - Subcommands: many commands have subcommands (e.g., `str trim`, `path join`, `date now`).
  - Type system: nushell has types (int, string, bool, list, record, table, duration, filesize, etc.).
  - To convert structured output to text: `| to text`, `| to json`, `| to csv`, `| to tsv`.
  - To parse text into structured data: `| from json`, `| from csv`, `| lines`, `| split column`.
  - Glob patterns: use `glob "**/*.ts"` instead of `find`.
  - Environment variables: `$env.HOME`, `$env.PATH`. Set with `$env.FOO = "bar"`.

Usage notes:
  - Either "command" or "script" is required (not both).
  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds. If not specified, commands will time out after 120000ms (2 minutes).
  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.
  - If the output exceeds 2000 lines or 51200 bytes, it will be truncated and the full output will be written to a file. You can use Read with offset/limit to read specific sections or Grep to search the full content. Because of this, you do NOT need to use truncation commands to limit output - just run the command directly.

  - Avoid using Nushell for `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` operations, unless explicitly instructed or when truly necessary. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools:
    - File search: Use Glob tool (NOT `glob` command or `ls`)
    - Content search: Use Grep tool (NOT `rg` or `open | find`)
    - Read files: Use Read tool (NOT `open` or `cat`)
    - Edit files: Use Edit tool (NOT string replacement in nushell)
    - Write files: Use Write tool (NOT `save` or `"content" | save`)
    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT `print` or `echo`)
  - When issuing multiple commands:
    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Nushell tool calls in a single message.
    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single call with ';' to chain them together (e.g., `git add .; git commit -m "message"; git push`).
    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands in inline mode (newlines are ok in quoted strings).
  - AVOID using `cd <directory>; <command>`. Use the `workdir` parameter to change directories instead.
    <good-example>
    Use workdir="/foo/bar" with command: pytest tests
    </good-example>
    <bad-example>
    cd /foo/bar; pytest tests
    </bad-example>

  - If the command output is valid JSON (e.g. from `| to json`), it will be auto-detected as structured data and included in metadata for richer display.

# Script file execution

When using the "script" argument:
  - Provide the path to a .nu file (relative to workdir or absolute).
  - Use "script_args" to pass arguments to the script.
  - The script will be executed as `nu <script_path> <args...>`.
  - Ensure the script file exists before execution.
  - Scripts can accept parameters using nushell's `def main` pattern:
    ```nu
    def main [name: string, --verbose(-v)] {
      if $verbose { print $"Hello, ($name)!" }
    }
    ```

# Committing changes with git

Only create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:

Git Safety Protocol:
- NEVER update the git config
- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it
- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it
- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:
  (1) User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including
  (2) HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')
  (3) Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows "Your branch is ahead")
- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit
- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)
- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.

1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following nushell commands in parallel, each using the Nushell tool:
  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.
  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.
  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.
2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:
  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. "add" means a wholly new feature, "update" means an enhancement to an existing feature, "fix" means a bug fix, etc.).
  - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc.). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files
  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the "why" rather than the "what"
  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose
3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands:
   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.
   - Create the commit with a message
   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.
   Note: git status depends on the commit completing, so run it sequentially after the commit.
4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)

Important notes:
- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git nushell commands
- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools
- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so
- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.
- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit

# Creating pull requests
Use the gh command via the Nushell tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a GitHub URL use the gh command to get the information needed.

IMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:

1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following nushell commands in parallel using the Nushell tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:
   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files
   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed
   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote
   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)
2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary
3. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested and all commands are likely to succeed, run multiple tool calls in parallel for optimal performance. run the following commands in parallel:
   - Create new branch if needed
   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed
   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC-style string to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.
<example>
gh pr create --title "the pr title" --body (["## Summary" "<1-3 bullet points>"] | str join "\n")
</example>

Important:
- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools
- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it
